# FRICTION IN 1D

With this code, given initial velocity and height of a point particle which is thrown up or down, velocity and height can be calculated in the presence of air friction. Each quantity comes with a graph as a function of time.



# WARNING!!!!!
 - I wrote this code for my scientific computation class in METU. Using the exact same code for the same class without any permission will have two results for you:

   1) Since I submitted the same code before, you will have a significantly high similarity. Thus, you will fail.
   2) You have to write this code by yourself. Cheating does not teach you how to use python for scientific computation. You should learn these stuff.
   
 - Other than that, you are free to take a look at it. For PHYS200 students, you should not copy the code and make some changes, then submit it, as I mentioned. Just give it a try and figure it out by yourself.
